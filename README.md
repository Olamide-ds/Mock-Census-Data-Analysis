🏙️ Mock Census Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a fictional census dataset from a mock town to help local government officials make informed decisions about land use and public investments. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization, it identifies demographic trends and provides strategic recommendations.

🧹 Data Cleaning

- The dataset included 9769 entries and 11 columns. Cleaning steps included:

- Handling missing and suspicious values

- Mapping and correcting categorical entries (e.g., marital status, infirmities)

- Grouping and imputing missing surnames by household

- Replacing invalid entries with contextually appropriate labels

📊 Analysis Highlights

✅ Youthful population: Most citizens are aged 20–39

🚉 Commuter-heavy town: Over 52% are regular commuters

🏘️ Underused housing: More than half the houses are under-occupied

🙏 Religious demand: 43.9% Christians but only one religious building

👴 Ageing concerns: High potential for increased elderly population in the future

🧠 Recommendations

- Based on the data and using elimination-by-aspects:

- Build a train station on the unoccupied land (top priority)

-  Invest in old-age care services for long-term community support

🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍

- Jupyter Notebook 📓

- Pandas, NumPy 🔢

- Seaborn, Matplotlib 📈
